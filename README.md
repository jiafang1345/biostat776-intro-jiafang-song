# About me
Hello! I'm a PhD student in Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University. I am interested in data science and try my best to learn how statistical methods could help the world. I like computing and developing softwares even though I am quite near the beginning. My research interests include brain imaging and spatial analysis.

# Interesting web page
This is a website of a tool of data visualization (https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-compare/), it could give descriptive results of global disease burden by regions, time, disease types and so on. Maybe this could be helpful for looking for research inspiration.
